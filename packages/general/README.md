# NPM

### We use [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com) to host our OSS libraries.

Add the [`package.json`](https://github.com/altnext/oss-tools/blob/main/packages/general/package.json) file from this directory to your project's root,
changing the [name](https://github.com/altnext/oss-tools/blob/main/packages/general/package.json#L2), [description](https://github.com/altnext/oss-tools/blob/main/packages/general/package.json#L4) and [`repository.url`](https://github.com/altnext/oss-tools/blob/main/packages/general/package.json#L14) as needed.

## Yarn

### We use [`yarn@1`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com) as our package manager.

Run `npm i -g yarn` to get the latest `yarn v1`.
To install dependencies in any project,
`cd` into it and run `yarn` at the command line.
