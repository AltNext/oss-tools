# NPM

### We use `npm` to host our OSS libraries.

Add the `package.json` file in this directory to your project's root,
changing the name as needed.

## Yarn

### We use `yarn@1` as our package manager

Run `npm i -g yarn` to get the latest `yarn v1`.
To install dependencies in any project,
`cd` into it and run `yarn` at the command line.
